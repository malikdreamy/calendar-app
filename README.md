# calendar-app
This is a Calendar/Schedle App. This app allows you to see the current date on the calendar and add events to your schedule tag. When you first go 
to the app you click on the date you want to schedule time in. You click the date and it becomes highlighted. After you click the date you go down to 
the green text area and add the time and event description. You add the time in the white textarea and the description in the green textarea. After you
finish you click the save button and it will save in your schedule tab. You can also remove it from the schedule if you press the red button that says
"Remove From Schedule". You can also add another event to that date by clicking the green button that says "Create New Event". When you press that button 
another schedule block is created under that date tab. You can add as many dates and schedules as you want. If you refresh the page the data persists
and your schedule stays there.
